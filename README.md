<p style="font-size:30px">JAVA GAME PROJECT: <b>HANGMAN</b></p>

As the application starts, it will display the name of the developer team and then the name of the game. Then, an intro screen, i.e. Main Menu, will display the Play, View Scoreboard, Instructions of Play and Exit Game options (or buttons). 

When a player selects the <b>Play</b> button, it will enter the game and immediately start the game with a random word picked out of the large word database. The screen will display a gallow without a body and beneath it will be the word presented with underscores and with a letter or two letters visible to give a hint for the word. 
The player will be able to click/cycle with arrow keys through the missing letters and enter the ones they think are correct. Each inccorect letter puts a body part on the gallow (head, torso, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg), and the letter dissapears while showing incorrect letters at the side of the screen. 
When the player enters a correct letter, the letter will turn green and stay there. For each word, there will be a time limit. 
When players advance through levels, that timer will become shorter and shorter, making the game harder. 
For each correct word, the player gets points and coins that they will be able to use as in-game currency to „buy“ hints for revealing the words they find too complicated, and perhaps eliminate an incorrect letter, giving them more opportunity to pass. 
With coins or points, the player will be able to customize the hanged man (like choosing a different skin) and change backgrounds. 
As long as the player manages to guess words, the game continues on, the player progresses from level 1, to level 2, and so on. When the player hangs the man (writes the incorrect word), the game ends and the player name goes into the scoreboard with the points that player got during his playtime, as well as the number of guessed words.

The <b>Coins</b> will have the following options:

-	Customize the Hanged Man skin
-	Customize the background
-	Customize the letter font
-	Reveal hints for words
-	Undo mistakes
-	Revive after the player guesses a word incorrectly and the game ends

The <b>View Scoreboard</b> button will enter a scoreboard with all the players who played the game, showing their names and points, sorting them from highest to lowest.

The <b>Instructions of Play</b> button will briefly explain how to play the game and explain how the coins function.

The <b>Exit Game</b> button will exit the app.
